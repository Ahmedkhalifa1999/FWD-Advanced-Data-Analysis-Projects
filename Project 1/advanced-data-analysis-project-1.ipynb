It is more a complicated problem than to be solved with mere numbers. Even after excluding overly successfull movies, there still can not be correlation to be found. Most probably, it's due to the unqunatizable nature of some aspects of movies that control their success.\n\n**Limitations:**\nAs mentioned in the previous paragraph, there are a lot of immeasurable factors that contribute to movie success. For example, the events that were occuring at the time of the movie release can greatly impact a movie success, just like we've seen this year with the COVID19 pandemic definitely affecting the success of many movies. Thus, it's almost impossible to figure figure out the factor that affect movie success based on simple statistical analysis alone, due to the nature of some factors being unmeasurable."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
